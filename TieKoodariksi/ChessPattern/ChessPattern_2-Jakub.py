"""
It’s a deep and silent night,
I cannot hear anything,
sleep for eternity!

The grieving, the fury, enveloped inside
such a maelstrom, it roars so loud
I’m losing my way in, the darkness tonight
silent, I’m fading out.

Cheating out each other
Betray one another
What’s the point,
when we know everything’s
so meaningless?

It’s a deep and silent night,
I cannot hear anything,
‘cause everything is fast asleep.
Now the world, so full of sin
It repeats itself again,
Such a relentless dream!

How much should I repent?
How can I atone
for the evil that I have done?
Who is it, the person, 
the one to forgive
me when I forgave none?

Good and evil clash with 
God and these emotions.
No one yet can see that
Everyone has been disposed.

In the dark and dirty light,
where I can no longer hide,
I am exposed, corrupted through.
In the moment, motionless
I will find my punishment.
This silent solitude!

Everyone is cheating,
constantly competing,
So many are dying,
Nothing stops the fighting,
People will desire
what they can’t acquire
Happiness, they dream of
what’s ahead - just out of reach.

And the voice I heard that day,
still it echoes on again,
It’s just beyond my memory.
In my mind, I’ll shut the door
To all these intrusive thoughts,
I’m drowning out the noise!

It’s a deep and silent night,
I cannot hear anything,
‘cause everything is fast asleep.
Now the world, so full of sin
It repeats itself again,
Such a relentless dream!
